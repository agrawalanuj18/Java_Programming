Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible:

	- Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)

	- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
	
	- It is open-source and free
	
	- It is secure, fast and powerful
	
	- It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
	
	- Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
	
	- As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
